# Enhanced DCGAN Research Package Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create Package Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir enhanced-dcgan-research
cd enhanced-dcgan-research
```

## Step 2: Create Package Directory and Copy Files

```bash
# Create the package directory
mkdir enhanced_dcgan_research

# Copy your existing Python files (NO CHANGES NEEDED)
cp /path/to/your/enhanced_dcgan_mnist_cifar_for_apple_mps_checkpoints_graceful_v02.py enhanced_dcgan_research/
cp /path/to/your/fully_integrated_report_v04.py enhanced_dcgan_research/

# Create the files from the artifacts above:
# - enhanced_dcgan_research/__init__.py
# - setup.py  
# - pyproject.toml
# - README.md
# - requirements.txt
# - build_and_upload.py
```

## Step 3: Add License and Manifest

Create `LICENSE`:
```
MIT License

Copyright (c) 2024 Your Name

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy

in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights

AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,

```

Create `MANIFEST.in`:
```
include README.md
include LICENSE
include requirements.txt
recursive-include enhanced_dcgan_research *.py
global-exclude __pycache__
global-exclude *.py[co]
```

## Step 4: Update Your Personal Information

Edit these files and replace placeholders:
- `setup.py`: Replace "Your Name", "your.email@example.com", and GitHub URL
- `pyproject.toml`: Replace the same information
- `README.md`: Replace GitHub URLs and author information
- `enhanced_dcgan_research/__init__.py`: Replace author info

## Step 5: Create TestPyPI Account

1. Go to https://test.pypi.org/
2. Create account
3. Go to Account Settings → API tokens
4. Create new token with scope "Entire account"
5. Save the token (you'll need it for uploading)

## Step 6: Build and Upload

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Method 1: Use the build script
python build_and_upload.py

# Method 2: Manual build and upload
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

## Step 7: Test Installation

```bash
# Install from TestPyPI
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ enhanced-dcgan-research

# Test the package
python -c "import enhanced_dcgan_research; print(enhanced_dcgan_research.get_info())"
```

## Directory Structure (Final)

```

## Usage After Installation

```python
# Import the package
import enhanced_dcgan_research as edr

# Train a model
ema_gen, critic = edr.train_enhanced_gan('mnist', num_epochs=25)

# Create academic report  
reporter, report_path = edr.create_academic_report('mnist')

# Check package info
info = edr.get_info()
print(info)
```

## Command Line Usage

```bash
# After installation, you can use:
enhanced-dcgan

# This will run your fully_integrated_report_v04.py main function
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure your original files don't have any absolute imports
2. **Missing Dependencies**: All PyTorch and ML dependencies are included in requirements
3. **Upload Errors**: Check your TestPyPI token and internet connection
4. **Version Conflicts**: Increment version number in setup.py for re-uploads

This setup keeps your original files unchanged while making them available as an installable package!
